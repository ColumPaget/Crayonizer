version 2.0 removes sound support, as this caused all kinds of headaches. Sound support will likely come back in a future release.



Version 0.5 includes a few important changes.

keyboard input is no longer automatically passed to the crayonized program, the new setting 'passinput' must be included in the entry for a given program.

The 'sentenv' verb no longer has the form 'setenv:<name>' but instead 'setenv <name>' (where <name> is the name of the environment variable to be set).


So, for example:

entry ssh
{
passinput
cmdline " \A*@*" setenv SSH_DEST
prepend "SSH $(SSH_DEST)" setxtitle hide
}
